What Improved? (The \"Keyword Stuffing\" Effect)\nThe changes made to the text generation strategy specifically adding *\"operating out of [Origin]\"*, *\"departs from X and arrives at Y\"*, and explicit IDs have yielded **drastic improvements** in retrieval quality compared to the first run.\n\n* **Route Accuracy is now near 100%:**\n    * *Previously:* Models struggled to distinguish Origin from Destination.\n    * *Now:* In **Q14** (\"Flights from JNX to EWX\") and **Q16** (\"Flights out of SEX\"), **ALL three models** successfully retrieved flights matching the specific airport codes. The phrasing *\"operating out of SEX\"* created a strong semantic hook that even the smaller MiniLM model could catch.\n* **Semantic Richness:**\n    * The generated text matches user queries much more naturally. When a user asks for \"severe delays\" or \"big delays\", the models now find text that explicitly says \"suffered a severe delay\", leading to higher confidence scores (0.80+ for MPNet/BGE-M3).\n\n### 2. The \"ID Lookup\" Limitation\n*Tests: Q18 (Record EPXXW8) and Q19 (Feedback F_18)*\n\n**Notice:** Despite adding *\"Passenger record locator is EPXXW8\"* to the text, **NONE of the models found the exact record in the top 3 results.**\n* **Why?** Vector embeddings capture *semantic meaning*, not exact character matching. To a language model, the random string `EPXXW8` looks semantically identical to `PQXXPR` or `NZXXC7` they are just \"alphanumeric codes.\"\n* **The Takeaway:** This validates your system architecture. **we cannot rely on Vector Search for ID lookups.** We **must** use the Router (Intent Classification) to send ID queries to **Cypher** (exact match), while reserving Vector Search for qualitative queries (\"bad food\", \"delays\").\n\n---\n\n### 3. Model Comparisons\n\n#### 🥇 Winner: BGE-M3 (BAAI/bge-m3)\n* **Performance:** Consistently the highest confidence scores (often >0.82).\n* **Route Handling:** It handled the \"Flights out of SEX\" query perfectly, returning multiple flights departing from that exact station.\n* **Nuance:** It showed the best balance in **Q6** (\"Great food but late flight\"), finding flights with high delays but 5/5 food scores, whereas others struggled to balance the contradicting sentiments.\n* **Verdict:** **The Best Choice.** It behaves most like a \"Hybrid\" retriever, respecting keywords while understanding sentiment.\n\n#### 🥈 Runner Up: MPNet (paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2)\n* **Performance:** Very strong on descriptive queries (Q1, Q9). It understands \"Nightmare journey\" very well.\n* **Improvement:** It significantly improved on Airport Codes compared to the previous run, thanks to the new text templates.\n* **Verdict:** A solid backup, but slightly less precise than BGE-M3 on edge-case entity matching.\n\n#### 🥉 Third Place: MiniLM (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)\n* **Performance:** Fastest, but lowest confidence scores (~0.60 - 0.75).\n* **Surprise Win:** It actually handled the Route queries (Q14, Q16) correctly this time! The \"operating out of\" phrasing helped this small model bridge the gap.\n* **Verdict:** Usable if hardware resources are very tight, but significantly less \"smart\" than BGE-M3.\n\n---\n\n\n### Visual Architecture Update\nThe failure of vector search to find exact IDs validates this flow:\n\n\n\n1.  **Input:** \"Record EPXXW8\"\n2.  **Intent Classifier:** Detects `lookup_details`\n3.  **Path:** Skips Vector Index $\\rightarrow$ Executes Cypher Exact Match.","metadata":{}}]}
