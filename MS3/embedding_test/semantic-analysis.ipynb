    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "After testing 3 embedding models against 17 distinct airline-related queries, **BAAI/bge-m3 (BGE-M3)** emerged as the superior model for this specific use case. While **MPNet** showed excellent semantic understanding of natural language concepts (like \"short-haul\" vs \"long-haul\"), **BGE-M3** was the only model capable of reliably capturing specific entities like Airport Codes (`SEX`, `JNX`) while maintaining high semantic accuracy. **MiniLM**, while likely the fastest, struggled significantly with numerical context and specific entity linking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Leaderboard\n",
    "\n",
    "| Rank | Model | Strength | Weakness | Recommendation |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| 🥇 | **BGE-M3** | **Hybrid Capabilities:** Excellent at both semantic nuances (\"bad food\") and exact keywords (Airport Codes). | Slower inference than MiniLM. | **Primary Choice** |\n",
    "| 🥈 | **MPNet** | **Semantic Depth:** Best understanding of length (\"short-haul\") and strong sentiment correlation. | **Keyword Blindness:** Completely failed to recognize specific airport codes (e.g., Q16). | Backup Choice |\n",
    "| 🥉 | **MiniLM** | **Speed:** Likely the fastest inference. | **Low Fidelity:** Confused \"Medium Haul\" for \"Short Haul\"; frequently missed negative sentiment in complex queries. | Not Recommended |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Analysis by Query Category\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Semantic Understanding (Sentiment & Length)\n",
    "*Tests: Q1, Q2, Q4, Q7, Q9*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Task:** Interpret \"short flight\", \"long haul\", \"nightmare\", and \"terrible food\".\n",
    "* **MPNet & BGE-M3 (Tie):** Both models correctly distinguished between \"Short-Haul\" (<1000 miles) and \"Long-Haul\" (>4000 miles). For Q2 (\"short flight\"), MPNet found flights under 900 miles, whereas MiniLM retrieved \"Medium-Haul\" flights over 1700 miles, failing the user intent.\n",
    "* **MiniLM (Fail):** In Q8 (\"Economy... good time\"), MiniLM retrieved a flight with a **2/5** food rating and called it a match. It struggled to separate the concept of \"flight\" from the specific sentiment \"good\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Entity & Keyword Recognition (Airport Codes)\n",
    "*Tests: Q11, Q16, Q17*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Task:** \"Flights out of SEX\" (Station Code). This is the hardest task for pure dense retrievers.\n",
    "* **BGE-M3 (Winner):** It was the **only** model to successfully map \"out of SEX\" to `Origin: SEX` (Q16).\n",
    "* **MPNet & MiniLM (Fail):** Both models treated \"SEX\" and \"JNX\" as generic noise, retrieving flights from random airports like `PHX`, `LHX`, or `BOX`.\n",
    "* **Why this matters:** Users frequently search by airport code. Only BGE-M3 demonstrated the \"Lexical + Semantic\" hybrid behavior needed for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Complex Logic & Edge Cases\n",
    "*Tests: Q6, Q9, Q14*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Task:** \"Food was great but flight was late\" (Mixed Sentiment) and \"Delay > 3 hours\" (Numerical reasoning).\n",
    "* **Mixed Sentiment (Universal Fail):** All three models struggled with Q6. They prioritized the \"flight\" vector and either found punctual flights or bad food. This confirms that **Embeddings cannot replace Cypher** for structured filtering (e.g., `WHERE food > 4 AND delay > 0`).\n",
    "* **Numerical nuances:**\n",
    "    * In Q14 (\"> 2000 miles\"), **MiniLM** actually performed surprisingly well, finding the `JNX -> EWX` route.\n",
    "    * In Q9 (\"Huge delay > 3 hours\"), **BGE-M3** found a massive 620-minute delay, showing better sensitivity to \"magnitude\" words like \"huge\" compared to MiniLM's 85-minute result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Demographic & Attribute Matching\n",
    "*Tests: Q4, Q5, Q12, Q15*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Task:** Match specific generations (\"Millennial\", \"Boomer\") or aircraft (\"A320-200\").\n",
    "* **Consistency:** All models performed adequately here, generally finding the correct Generation or Status when explicitly requested.\n",
    "* **Nuance:** **MPNet** seemed slightly better at pairing the demographic with the correct *sentiment* (e.g., finding an unhappy Millennial rather than just *any* Millennial).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "For the Airline Graph-RAG system, **we will proceed with BGE-M3.**\n",
    "\n",
    "While MPNet offers slightly better \"literary\" understanding of sentiments, an airline system **must** respect airport codes and specific entities. BGE-M3's ability to act as a hybrid retriever—catching the keyword \"SEX\" (airport) while still understanding \"severe delay\"—makes it the robust choice to minimize hallucinations."
